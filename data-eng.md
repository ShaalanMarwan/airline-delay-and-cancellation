# Airline Delay and Cancellation Data Engineering Project

This project is designed to explore and analyze a dataset of airline delay and cancellation data from 2009 to 2018. The goal of the project is to develop a scalable data pipeline that can ingest, process, and analyze large volumes of data in the cloud.

## Problem Description

The primary problem that this project solves is how to efficiently process and analyze a large dataset of airline delay and cancellation data, in order to gain insights into trends and patterns over time.

## Cloud

The project will be developed in the cloud, using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to manage and automate the deployment of infrastructure. The specific cloud provider and tools used will depend on the requirements of the project.

## Data Ingestion

Data ingestion will be performed using batch processing or streaming technologies, depending on the requirements of the project. For batch processing, workflow orchestration tools will be used to manage the data pipeline. For streaming, consumer/producer and streaming technologies like Kafka streaming, Spark streaming, or Flink will be used.

## Data Warehouse

A data warehouse will be set up to store and manage the processed data. The tables will be partitioned and clustered in a way that makes sense for the queries that will be run upstream. An explanation will be provided for why this particular structure was chosen.

## Transformations

Transformations will be defined using technologies like dbt, Spark, or similar tools to transform the raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis. The specific transformations will depend on the requirements of the project.

## Dashboard

A dashboard will be created with at least two tiles to display relevant information from the data. The specific tiles and metrics displayed will depend on the requirements of the project.

## Reproducibility

The code for this project will be designed to be easy to run and to reproduce, so that others can build upon it and contribute to the project.

## Conclusion

This data engineering project will provide a scalable and efficient solution for processing and analyzing a large dataset of airline delay and cancellation data. The project will be developed in the cloud using modern tools and technologies, and will emphasize reproducibility and automation.
